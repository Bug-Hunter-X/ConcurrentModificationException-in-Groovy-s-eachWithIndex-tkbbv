This repository demonstrates a common error in Groovy when using the `eachWithIndex` method to iterate over a list and modify it simultaneously.  The example code attempts to remove an element from the list while iterating, which leads to a `ConcurrentModificationException`. The solution provides an alternative approach using a copy of the list or an iterator that allows modifications.
